QKDTI: Quantum Kernel-Based Machine Learning Model for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction
This repository contains all source code, scripts, data instructions, preprocessed results, and trained models used in the paper titled "QKDTI: A Quantum Kernel-Based Machine Learning Model for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction".
ðŸ§ª Overview
QKDTI integrates NystrÃ¶m-approximated quantum kernels with support vector regression and hybrid quantum-classical architectures (Quantum Transformers, QNN-DNN) to predict drug-target binding affinity. The framework has been evaluated on three benchmark datasets: DAVIS, KIBA, and BindingDB.
